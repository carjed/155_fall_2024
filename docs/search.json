Even if you’ve already downloaded both R and RStudio, you’ll want to re-download to make sure that you have the most current versions.\n\nRequired: Change the default file download location for your internet browser.\n\nGenerally by default, internet browsers automatically save all files to the Downloads folder on your computer. This does not encourage good file organization practices. You need to change this option so that your browser asks you where to save each file before downloading it.\nThis page has information on how to do this for the most common browsers.\n\n\nRequired: Download R and RStudio.\n\nFIRST: Download R here.\n\nIn the top section, you will see three links “Download R for …”\nChoose the link that corresponds to your computer.\nAs of August 27, 2024, the latest version of R is 4.4.1 (“Race for Your Life”).\n\nSECOND: Download RStudio here.\n\nClick the button under step 2 to install the version of RStudio recommended for your computer.\nAs of August 27, 2024, the latest version of RStudio is 2024.04.2+764.\n\n\n\nSuggested: Watch this video describing key configuration options for RStudio.\n\nRequired: Install required packages.\n\nAn R package is an extra bit of functionality that will help us in our data analysis efforts in a variety of ways.\nOpen RStudio and click inside the Console pane (by default, the bottom left pane). Copy and paste the following command into the Console. You should see the text below appear to the right of the &gt;, which is called the R prompt. After you paste, hit Enter.\n\n\ninstall.packages(c(\"tidyverse\"))\n\n\nYou will see a lot of text from status messages appearing in the Console as the packages are being installed. Wait until you see the &gt; again.\nEnter the command library(tidyverse) and hit Enter.\nIf you see an error message, then there was a problem installing the package. Talk to the instructor or a preceptor for help.\nQuit RStudio. You’re done setting up!\n\n\nOptional: For a tour of RStudio features, watch this video. It also shows you how to customize the layout and color scheme of RStudio.\n\nRequired: Set essential RStudio options.\nGo to Tools -&gt; Global Options -&gt; General -&gt; Workplace. You’ll see 2 options:\n\nRestore .RData into workspace at startup: Leave this unchecked\nSave workspace to .RData on exit: Select “Never”\n\nWithout doing this RStudio will save and reload everything that you’ve been working on from the start of the semester. Since we’ll be working with new data each class, we want to keep our digital environment clean. Essentially, this is like an artist getting a clean canvas for each new painting rather than trying to paint all paintings on a single canvas."

Although the first two checkpoints will not directly contribute to your course grade, the feedback they allow me to provide will ensure the success of your final draft!\n\n\nResources\nLater in the semester, I will post at least one example of a successful final draft, as well as a google doc template for the final draft.\n\n\nProject Groups\nProject groups will ultimately be determined by me, with the assistance of a Project Group Preferences survey. The survey will be sent out early in the semester (exact date TBD) and will allow you to either list people you would like to be in a group with or specify that you would like to be placed in a group randomly by me. I will do my best to ensure that groups are constructed as closely to survey responses as possible. Since one component of the project involves an in-class presentation, you may not work with students in different sections on the project.\nIf for any reason there is an individual (or individuals) with whom you do not feel safe participating in a project group with, there will be a space to note this on the survey. You will not be expected to provide any justification for your response to this question, but note that as I need to place you in groups, the survey will not be anonymous.\nGroup work and collaboration are important components of nearly all statistical analyses and projects. I recognize that individual contributions to a group project are not always consistent between group members. To this end, you will (as a group) be expected to explicitly specify the project tasks completed by each team member along with the final draft of your paper.\nIf there are any concerns with project groups throughout the semester, I am happy to meet with groups or individuals to discuss ways to move forward."

You can schedule a time to meet with me using this link.\n\n\n\n\nThis course provides an introduction to statistical modeling. In other words, you will develop the basic skills to analyze data, test research hypotheses, and make predictions about the world.\nBeing able to summarize, interpret, and communicate about data are crucial for navigating today’s information landscape, and these are precisely the skills that we’ll build in this class. Throughout the semester, we’ll study the fundamental methods that statisticians use to extract knowledge from data, emphasizing statistical literacy & intuition, real data applications, and modern computing over memorizing facts and formulas.\n\n\nBy actively participating in this course, you will develop and/or strengthen your abilities to:\n\nVisualize: explore, understand, and describe patterns in data with plots and graphics\nModel: build, interpret, and evaluate statistical models to identify trends in data\nInfer: extend observations from sample data to draw conclusions and make predictions\nCompute: use the (free!) statistical software R to analyze real data and create reproducible reports\nContextualize: interpret results in context, by considering the methods of data collection, the scientific and social contexts, and ethical dimensions\nCommunicate: accurately describe methods and results in a way that is scientifically sound and widely accessible\nCollaborate: work productively and effectively in a group setting\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is no required textbook for this course. Throughout the course, readings may be assigned from these notes, or other sources. All links and materials needed will be provided on the home page of this website.\nThe best resources for this course are course content videos, attending and participating in class / assignments, and office hours. I am happy to talk about possible additional materials / strategies for effective learning at any time throughout the semester!\n\n\n\nWe will use the (completely free and open source) R programming language extensively throughout this course. RStudio (an interface for R) will facilitate our use of R. You may use RStudio in one of two ways:\n\nDesktop version: Download for Windows or Mac at https://posit.co/downloads/. Note: You first need to download and install R on your computer in order to use the desktop version of RStudio\nOnline: Go to https://rstudio.macalester.edu, and log in with your full Mac email address and your usual Mac password to get access. (Note that this is a shared resource across MSCS, and you may experience performance issues due to high traffic, server outages, etc.)\n\nMore detailed instructions on downloading, installing, and getting started with R, RStudio, and an important package called Quarto is available on the Tech Setup tab.\n\n\n\n\nWhen taking a new course, figuring out the right workflow/cadence of effort throughout the week can be a big adjustment. And most of you are doing this for 4 different courses! Below are some suggestions for what to expect in the course and how to focus your time and attention during and outside of class.\n\n\nPre-class videos/readings: Some class periods will have required videos or reading to get acquainted with new concepts before seeing them again in class. My goal for these videos and readings is for you to get the most out of class time by being able to more easily follow explanations in class and to engage most fully in class activities. When there are required readings or videos, there will be an associated checkpoint to complete on Moodle (due 30 minutes before the start of the next class).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggestions\n\n\n\n\nAs you take notes on videos/readings, highlight or otherwise mark all the areas where you have questions. Gather up all of these questions in one place, and bring them to class with you.\nRecord any reflections from in-class time about your learning process or interactions with peers while they are still fresh.\nAfter learning a new topic in class, it is helpful to attempt the upcoming assignment as soon as possible. Just by getting some rough ideas down quickly, you avoid the difficulty of starting from a blank slate.\nCome to instructor and preceptor drop-in hours (office hours) to chat about the course or anything else!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClass time will be a mix of interactive lecture and longer stretches of group work. During the lecture portion, I will pause explanation frequently to prompt a short exercise or ask questions that you’ll reflect on individually or together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggestions\n\n\n\n\nAs we review the material at the start of class and as you work on the class activity, reference your set of questions from the pre-class material. Have you made progress on addressing those questions? Who or what helped with improving your understanding, and how?"

In other words, you will develop the basic skills to analyze data, test research hypotheses, and make predictions about the world.\nBeing able to summarize, interpret, and communicate about data are crucial for navigating today’s information landscape, and these are precisely the skills that we’ll build in this class. Throughout the semester, we’ll study the fundamental methods that statisticians use to extract knowledge from data, emphasizing statistical literacy & intuition, real data applications, and modern computing over memorizing facts and formulas.\n\n\nBy actively participating in this course, you will develop and/or strengthen your abilities to:\n\nVisualize: explore, understand, and describe patterns in data with plots and graphics\nModel: build, interpret, and evaluate statistical models to identify trends in data\nInfer: extend observations from sample data to draw conclusions and make predictions\nCompute: use the (free!) statistical software R to analyze real data and create reproducible reports\nContextualize: interpret results in context, by considering the methods of data collection, the scientific and social contexts, and ethical dimensions\nCommunicate: accurately describe methods and results in a way that is scientifically sound and widely accessible\nCollaborate: work productively and effectively in a group setting\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is no required textbook for this course. Throughout the course, readings may be assigned from these notes, or other sources. All links and materials needed will be provided on the home page of this website.\nThe best resources for this course are course content videos, attending and participating in class / assignments, and office hours. I am happy to talk about possible additional materials / strategies for effective learning at any time throughout the semester!\n\n\n\nWe will use the (completely free and open source) R programming language extensively throughout this course. RStudio (an interface for R) will facilitate our use of R. You may use RStudio in one of two ways:\n\nDesktop version: Download for Windows or Mac at https://posit.co/downloads/. Note: You first need to download and install R on your computer in order to use the desktop version of RStudio\nOnline: Go to https://rstudio.macalester.edu, and log in with your full Mac email address and your usual Mac password to get access. (Note that this is a shared resource across MSCS, and you may experience performance issues due to high traffic, server outages, etc.)\n\nMore detailed instructions on downloading, installing, and getting started with R, RStudio, and an important package called Quarto is available on the Tech Setup tab.\n\n\n\n\nWhen taking a new course, figuring out the right workflow/cadence of effort throughout the week can be a big adjustment. And most of you are doing this for 4 different courses! Below are some suggestions for what to expect in the course and how to focus your time and attention during and outside of class.\n\n\nPre-class videos/readings: Some class periods will have required videos or reading to get acquainted with new concepts before seeing them again in class. My goal for these videos and readings is for you to get the most out of class time by being able to more easily follow explanations in class and to engage most fully in class activities. When there are required readings or videos, there will be an associated checkpoint to complete on Moodle (due 30 minutes before the start of the next class).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggestions\n\n\n\n\nAs you take notes on videos/readings, highlight or otherwise mark all the areas where you have questions. Gather up all of these questions in one place, and bring them to class with you.\nRecord any reflections from in-class time about your learning process or interactions with peers while they are still fresh.\nAfter learning a new topic in class, it is helpful to attempt the upcoming assignment as soon as possible. Just by getting some rough ideas down quickly, you avoid the difficulty of starting from a blank slate.\nCome to instructor and preceptor drop-in hours (office hours) to chat about the course or anything else!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClass time will be a mix of interactive lecture and longer stretches of group work. During the lecture portion, I will pause explanation frequently to prompt a short exercise or ask questions that you’ll reflect on individually or together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggestions\n\n\n\n\nAs we review the material at the start of class and as you work on the class activity, reference your set of questions from the pre-class material. Have you made progress on addressing those questions? Who or what helped with improving your understanding, and how?"

For example, if your first attempt on a 1-point question is incorrect, the maximum possible score on that question is 0.67 points for the second attempt. On the third attempt, the maximum score is 0.33 points. No points are awarded for the 4th attempt and beyond.\n\n\nPractice problems\nTo practice concepts that we cover in class, there will be 8 weekly practice problems (PPs) due on Fridays at 5pm. (Note that if needed, extensions are possible—see the late work policy.)\nYou will receive qualitative feedback on all questions on these practice problem sets. These assignments will receive on overall score on the following scale:\n\nHigh pass: 2 points\nPass: 1 point\nNeeds improvement: 0 points\n\nShowing growth: If, on a quiz, you demonstrate stronger understanding of the concepts that you missed on a PP, you have the chance to earn a higher score on the PP. Either via email or through an in-person conversation with the instructor, you must discuss how your understanding of the concept(s) changed from the PP to the quiz by addressing feedback from both the PP and the quiz. You can do this once for each quiz (excluding the final), and you can show improvement on multiple PPs using a single quiz.\n\n\nQuizzes\nThere will be 3 quizzes over the course of the semester.\n\nQuiz 1: Thursday, 9/26. 1 hour in class.\nQuiz 2: Thursday, 10/31. 1 hour in class. Will cover material from the first quiz to some extent because of the way that material in this course builds on earlier ideas.\nQuiz 3: ~1.25 hours during our final exam slot. Will cover content from the whole course.\n\nSection 05: Saturday, 12/14 1:30-3:30pm. Section 06: Monday, 12/16 1:30-3:30pm.\nEach quiz question will be graded on the following scale:\n\n3 points: fully correct\n2 points: mostly correct with minor errors\n1 point: missing key understanding\n0 points: fully off target or blank\n\nQuiz format:\n\nFully pen/pencil and paper. You will not need to write code or use a calculator, but you will need to be able to read and interpret output from R code.\nYou are allowed to bring a 3x5 index card with notes written on both sides. Typing your notes and pasting them on the card is fine.\n\nShowing growth: You can earn up to 50% of missed points back on quizzes if you complete a quiz correction and reflection. You must:\n\nWrite a reflection of how you prepared for the quiz and where you felt strongest and more uncertain in your understanding before taking the quiz\nSchedule a meeting with the instructor. During our conversation, you will correct your quiz responses and discuss the above reflection. You will get immediate feedback at this meeting. Use my appointment booking link to schedule this meeting.\n\n\n\nProject\nThe goal of the course project is to apply the data analysis skills from our course to investigate a research question in a dataset of your choosing. Through milestones over the course of the semester, you will make steady progress on your projects and iterate on feedback. Full details about the project will be available on the Project page."

The purpose of deadlines (and extensions) is to keep you accountable for your own learning, to keep you on track with the pace of the course (which builds upon itself throughout the semester), and to provide preceptors and myself the ability to give you timely feedback on assignments.\nIn order to use an extension, you must email me (jcarls13@macalester.edu) before the practice problem deadline to inform me you plan to use an extension. In your email, please specify (1) that you are using an extension, and (2) your self-set deadline is for the assignment. You do not need to specify a reason. For example, you could say “I am using my second extension. I will have Practice Problems #7 in by 5:00pm two days from now.” Once you set your deadline, I expect you to stick to it. If you do not e-mail me prior to the practice problem deadline, the extension will not be counted, and your assignment will be counted as late.

    "section": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) Use",
    "text": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) Use\nSome of you may actively use (or be interested in using) Generative AI tools (ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Claude, etc.) to find/synthesize information or augment your writing/coding. Building literacy with how these tools work may be extremely important in your future for economic reasons (job skills) as well as cultural ones (meme skills).\nHowever, in an introductory course like this one, I strongly discourage the use of AI, for three main reasons:\n\nWe are learning the essentials of a new language and way of thinking. My mandate as an educator is to help build new neural networks in your own squishy, magnificent brains that cost $0, take up about 1.3 liters of space, and consume 20 watts of energy, not in a $100 billion, 1000-acre supercomputing cluster that consumes 5 gigawatts of energy.\nI care much more about developing your ability to identify interesting problems, iteratively seek a solution, and convince the world that your solution works than I do about your ability to find answers that are already known (using AI or otherwise). Remember that “generative” AI is only capable of remixing existing information–it cannot create new knowledge, situate that knowledge in the context of your lived experience, or instigate change.\nIn this course, I hope to emphasize the importance of process over output. Consider an analogy of a painting class at Macalester. You’re a novice painter, but you have a strong point of view and a solid understanding of context and tradition, so you decide to write an AI prompt to generate the artwork and translate it to physical media. After lots of wordsmithing and iterations on Midjourney, your AI-generated image ready. It’s provocative and beautiful…it will look even better on canvas! You get to work, admiring yourself for finishing faster than your classmates because you knew exactly what your final product would look like. You step back to admire your masterpiece, and realize it’s at best a paint-by-numbers, and at worst, complete garbage because you were so focused on crafting the perfect AI prompt that you didn’t really learn how to mix colors or use different brush techniques.\n\nLearning how to do something the “long” or “hard” way is beneficial not only for developing critical thinking skills, but because that process can be enriching and fulfilling in its own right. Though AI can (sometimes) put access to answers at your fingertips, it cannot replace the physical, sensory, and emotional experience of sketching out ideas on a whiteboard with friends, stopping by your professor’s office for a donut, or the satisfaction of knowing that you can do something hard from scratch.\nIn addition, please be aware of the many technical limitations and ethical considerations of using AI:\n\nAI does not always generate accurate output. If it gives you a number, fact, or code, assume it is wrong unless you either know the answer or can check in with another source. AI works best for topics you already understand to a sufficient extent.\nIf you provide minimum effort prompts, you will get low quality results. You will need to refine your prompts in order to get good outcomes. This will take work.\nBe thoughtful about when this tool is useful. Don’t use it if it isn’t appropriate for the case or circumstance.\nThe environmental impact of AI should not be ignored. The building and usage of AI tools consumes a lot of energy (see here and here). For this reason, we will be very thoughtful about when we use AI and will discuss other sustainability behaviors that we can incorporate into our lives to offset this usage.\n\nAll of that being said, I cannot (nor do I want to) enforce my personal perspective on students who wish to use AI to enhance their learning. If you do choose to use AI, any ideas, language, or code that is produced by AI must be cited, just like any other resource. - How to cite AI: If you have used AI in any assignment, please include a paragraph at the end explaining what you used the AI for and what prompts you used to get the results. Failure to do so is in violation of the academic integrity policy at Macalester College.\nIf you have any questions about your use of AI tools, please contact me to discuss them."

Investing time into taking care of yourself will have profound impacts on all aspects of your life. Remember that beyond being a student, you are a human being carrying your own experiences, thoughts, emotions, and identities. It is important to acknowledge any stressors you may be facing, which can be mental, emotional, physical, cultural, financial, etc., and how they can have an impact on you. I encourage you to remember that you have a body with needs. In the classroom, eat when you are hungry, drink water, use the restroom, and step out if you are upset and need some air. Please do what is necessary so long as it does not impede your or others’ ability to be mentally and emotionally present in the course. Outside of the classroom, sleeping well, moving your body, and connecting with others can be strategies can help nourish you. If you are having difficulties maintaining your well-being, please don’t hesitate to contact me and/or find support from physical and mental health resources here, here, and here."

    "section": "Exercise 4: Exploring themes in the letters",
    "text": "Exercise 4: Exploring themes in the letters\nThe dplyr package provides many useful functions for managing data (like creating new variables, summarizing information). The stringr package provides tools for working with strings (text). We’ll use these packages to search for words in the questions in order to (roughly) identify themes/subjects.\nThe code below searches for words related to mothers, fathers, marriage, and money and combines them into a single theme variable.\n\nInside mutate() the line moms = ifelse(str_detect(question_only, \"mother|mama|mom\"), \"mom\", \"no mom\") creates a new variable called moms. If any of the text “mother”, “mama”, or “mom” (which covers “mommy”) is found, then the variable takes the value “mom”. Otherwise, the variable takes the value “no mom”.\nThe dads, marriage, and money variables are created similarly.\nThe themes = str_c(moms, dads, marriage, money, sep = \"|\") line takes the 4 created variables and combines the text of those variables separated with a |. For example, one value of the themes variable is “mom|no_dad|no_marriage|no_money” (which contains words about moms but not dads, marriage, or money).\n\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(stringr)\n\nabby &lt;- abby %&gt;% \n    mutate(\n        moms = ifelse(str_detect(question_only, \"mother|mama|mom\"), \"mom\", \"no mom\"),\n        dads = ifelse(str_detect(question_only, \"father|papa|dad\"), \"dad\", \"no dad\"),\n        marriage = ifelse(str_detect(question_only, \"marriage|marry|married\"), \"marriage\", \"no marriage\"),\n        money = ifelse(str_detect(question_only, \"money|finance\"), \"money\", \"no money\"),\n        themes = str_c(moms, dads, marriage, money, sep = \"|\")\n    )\n\n\nModify the code above however you wish to replace themes (e.g., replace “moms” with something else) or add new themes to search for. If you want to add a new subject to search for, copy and paste a line for an existing subject above the themes line, and modify the code like this:\n\nIf your subject is captured by multiple words: YOUR_SUBJECT = ifelse(str_detect(question_only, \"WORD1|WORD2|ETC\"), \"SUBJECT\", \"NO SUBJECT\"),\nIf your subject is captured by a single word: YOUR_SUBJECT = ifelse(str_detect(question_only, \"WORD\"), \"SUBJECT\", \"NO SUBJECT\"),\nTry to have no more than 6 subjects—otherwise we’ll have too many themes, which will complicate exploration.\n\nThe code below makes a barplot of the themes variable using the ggplot2 visualization package. Before making the plot, make note of what you expect the plot might look like. (This might be hard–just do your best!) Then compare to what you observe when you run the code chunk to make the plot. (Clearly defining your expectations first is good scientific practice to avoid confirmation bias.)\n\n\n# Load package\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# barplot\nggplot(abby, aes(x = themes)) +\n    geom_bar() +\n    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))\n\n\nWe can follow up on the barplot with a simple numerical summary. Whereas the ggplot2 package is great for visualizations, dplyr is great for numerical summaries. The code below constructs a table of the number of questions with each theme. Make sure that these numerical summaries match up with what you saw in the barplot.\n\n\n# Construct a table of counts\nabby %&gt;% \n    count(themes)\n\n\nBefore proceeding, let’s break down the plotting code above. Run each chunk to see how the two lines of code above build up the plot in “layers”. Add comments (on the lines starting with #) to document what you notice.\n\n\n# ???\nggplot(abby, aes(x = themes))\n\n\n# ???\nggplot(abby, aes(x = themes)) +\n    geom_bar()\n\n\n# ???\nggplot(abby, aes(x = themes)) +\n    geom_bar() +\n    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))\n\n\n# ???\nggplot(abby, aes(x = themes)) +\n    geom_bar() +\n    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) +\n    theme_classic()",
